It happens. Maybe server has issues, maybe visitor&#39;s ISP has issues.</p><p>In case main API host cannot be reached, Iconify public API has backup host names:</p><ul><li><span class="hljs-inline-link">https://api.simplesvg.com</span></li><li><span class="hljs-inline-link">https://api.unisvg.com</span></li></ul><p>Each of backup host names points to half of API servers. For example, in western Europe there are currently 2 servers: in Frankfurt and in London. Main host points to both, one of backup hosts points to server in Frankfurt, another backup host points to server in London. If server in Frankfurt goes down, users that are using that server can be redirected to server in London using one of backup host names.</p><p>Redundancy built in Iconify icon components accounts for that. It tries to connect to main host first, then, if there was no response in reasonable time (timeout is 0.75 seconds), it attempts to connect to one of backup hosts, then to another backup host. Small delay caused by check only affects first query, all further API queries are sent to host that responded.</p><p>See <a href="./cdn.html">building redundant API</a> for more details.</p><h2 id="queries" tabindex="-1">Queries <a class="header-anchor" href="#queries" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Queries&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Iconify API can be used to render SVG, to retrieve icon data, to browse and search icons.</p><p>For full list of supported queries, their parameters and API responses see <a href="./queries.html">Iconify API queries documentation</a>.</p><h2 id="api-providers" tabindex="-1">API providers <a class="header-anchor" href="#api-providers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;API providers&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Iconify icon components can retrieve icons from multiple API servers.</p><p>This allows you to run your own API to serve only custom icons, while using public Iconify API to get data for open source icon sets.</p><p>See <a href="./providers.html">Iconify API providers</a> for details.</p>',31)]))}const f=o(r,[["render",a]]);export{d as __pageData,f as default};
